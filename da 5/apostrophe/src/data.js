      \n \
      at season’s height we fight for a limited audience. few dancers. \n \
      fewer cheers. down by 30 and our coach m.i.a. we, foolish, dribble. \n \
      each bounce-back brings a stranger. can’t call us for traveling because \n \
      \n \
      we ain’t going nowhere. instead, we trade terrified looks. search\n \
      for the pass but no one stays open for long. even if we knew what to do\n \

        lady i swear by all flowers. Don’t cry—the best gesture of my brain is less than\n \
        your eyelids’ flutter which says\n \
        we are for each other: then\n \
        laugh, leaning back in my arms\n \

        The days are cold and so very long.\n \
        I don't know how much longer I can be strong.\n \

        My nights are so lonely and sad.\n \
        Sometimes I can't help but get mad. \n \
        \n \
        I see your face everywhere I look.\n \
        It breaks my heart that my great love is what they took.\n \
        \n \
        Without you here it feels like the end.\n \
        I'm lost without you 'cause you were also my best friend.\n \
        \n \
        I'll be counting the days and nights till we're together again.\n \
        Until then, it's all my love that I send!",
