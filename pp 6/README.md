React Router
https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial

I want to learn about this technology since I plan on using it for my personal portfolio website. I use the react framework pretty often, so adding onto that knowledge with routing for different web addresses will be pretty useful.

I had this done on a private repo earlier, but realized I couldn't share that one easily so I moved the files onto this one.
